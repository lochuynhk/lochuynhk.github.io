Climate change and global warming has been the hot topic over recent years. With the extreme weather and recent fire that occurred in California and Australia, I believe it is more important now than ever to bring more awareness to this topic.

One of the reasons for the increase in global temperature is due to the high amount of CO2 released to our atmosphere. Data collected by the United Nations from 1975-2014 shows that output of CO2 has been on the rise year after year as countries are burning more fuels to meet the need of its population and consumers.

Carbon dioxide is released through the burning of hydrocarbon fuels like wood, coal, natural gas, gasoline, and oil. Developed countries are responsible for releasing million of metric tons of CO2 to the atmosphere each year.

The top 20 developed countries produced more than 80 percent of the world CO2 emission. In order for us to reduce CO2 emission, we need changes from the top. If the top 20 countries can come together and agreed to start transition to alternative energy, we might have hope to reverse the damage.
